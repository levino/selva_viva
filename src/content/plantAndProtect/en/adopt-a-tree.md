description_title: HOW DOES IT WORK?
description: >-
  Your adopted tree belongs to a regionally - often internationally - rare species. We plant it together with other native tree species in a biodiverse ecosystem, providing a home to many animals and plants. This system not only stores carbon more efficiently than monoculture plantations but also offers better living conditions for the trees (soil quality, pest resistance, etc.).


  If your tree does not grow, we will replant it. We protect these trees for at least 20 years.


  Every living specimen of an endangered species can help preserve its kind for the region and the world.

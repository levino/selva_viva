description_title: HOW DOES IT WORK?
description: >-
  Your tree ward belongs to a regionally - often internationally - rare species. We plant it together with other native tree species in a biodiverse ecosystem, providing a home to many animals and plants. This not only stores carbon more efficiently than monoculture plantations but also provides better living conditions for the trees (soil quality, pest resistance, etc.).


  If your tree does not grow, we will replant it, of course. We protect these trees for at least 20 years.


  Every living specimen of an endangered species can help preserve its kind for the region and its tropical ecosystem.

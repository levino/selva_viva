<h2 id="nursery">About Our Three Goals</h2>

### I) We Plant and Care for Endangered Species

#### Because rare rainforest trees no longer spread on their own.

The rainforest of this region (Darién-Chocó) is one of the most biodiverse habitats worldwide (more about the [biodiversity hotspot](./the-farm/full-text#region-significance)). However, this Chocó region is highly threatened by deforestation.
The offspring of more heavily exploited species are often found in remote and hard-to-reach places where mother plants still exist and provide seeds. Only a few shoots survive under mother plants, and only if the mother plant dies in time and makes room for a young tree. Only the strongest survive. <br>
We search for and rescue some of the seeds and young seedlings of these endangered tree species. Some specimens also grow on pastures - there, the shoots must be saved from the use of herbicides in a timely manner. Sometimes we succeed in being in the right place at the right time.<br>
So far, we sow or plant the seeds or seedlings afterward (under conditions adapted to their needs) in our sowing bags or in nursery beds if the shoots allow for later selection and transplanting. In the future, there will also be tree islands for some of the species, more on this in our [Tree Island newsletter](https://vivalaselva.substack.com/p/tree-islands).

For our mature seedlings and our tree islands, we look for safe places with suitable soil properties to grow and produce flowers, fruits, and seeds. With the help of wind, bats, and birds, their seeds can also spread again. With a little luck, one or more trees may grow on their own over time, and the cycle continues in the wilderness. Additionally, our protégés, with their seeds and seedlings, can provide genetic material for reforestation projects.

### II) We Plant ALTERNATIVE TIMBER SPECIES

#### Because effective protection for endangered species must provide the people of the region with meaningful alternatives for their homes and fences.

The Chocó-Darién region is geographically delimited by the Caribbean coast and the Gulf of Urabá (in the northeast), the Atrato River and an adjacent rainforest area (in the south), and the Darién mountain range with the border to Panama (in the west) like an island "in front of" the "Colombian mainland."

This explains, on the one hand, the - now endangered - abundance of endemic species but also hampers work and trade in the region. The only significant legal source of income is livestock farming. Building materials such as concrete and steel are expensive and their procurement is logistically demanding, many houses and pasture fence posts are still made of wood. Instead of cutting down regionally or globally endangered species for this purpose, more such species that are equally well-suited but grow back more easily and quickly should be available in the region.
Among them are tree species that serve as living fences, holding the wire fence and providing shade, root systems, and food for animals and soil. These species include Fría and Mataratón, the latter is also used medicinally (e.g., mosquito protection).

### III) We Plant MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRUIT TREES

#### Because fruit and homemade juices are healthier for humans and the environment than colorful sodas in plastic bottles with long transport routes. Moreover, they provide food for animal species that we urgently need as pollinators and seed dispersers for endangered tree species.

Fruit trees have shorter life cycles. They are also more susceptible to pests or had to give way to the space requirements of pastures and buildings. They exist, but in fewer numbers and less diversity; not enough replanting has been done. The once widely accepted right to pick fruit for a little snack on the go has been increasingly restricted by cutting down trees on pastures, with the argument that fences suffered from pedestrian traffic.

However, people and animals live on limes, mandarins, oranges, avocados, mangoes, guavas, chili, bananas, coconuts, etc. Their consumption prevents diseases like dengue fever and malaria or helps to recover from them. The import of fruit into the isolated region (see above) is difficult due to high temperatures, high humidity, rough seas, and high transport costs across the gulf. Plastic bottles filled with over-sugared colorful drinks withstand the journey better. However, local fruit trees offer a cheaper, healthier, plastic-free, and CO2-negative alternative and are therefore important for the health of people and nature in the region.
And last but not least, fruit trees provide a food source for all the animals that can help us pollinate the endangered species and distribute their seeds far and wide.

## About Our Work

### Small Challenges

#### Finding the growth conditions for wild rainforest species

- Soil mixture
- General moisture level
- Resistance to waterlogging
- Light requirements
- Tolerance to direct sunlight
- Compatibility with other forest inhabitants (parasites, predators, etc.)

### A Small Matter of Conscience

#### Plastic in Tree Nurseries

To avoid unnecessary plastic in seedling bags and plastic mesh fabric as shading and heavy rain protection, we sow (depending on the amount of available genetic material) the seeds or small seedlings in nursery beds or (only in very small numbers and high threat status of the species) additionally in seedling bags, which we also try to recycle. With a larger supply of seeds, various species can soon be planted together in tree islands, directly in the ground at the destination. Read more about the [tree island concept](https://vivalaselva.substack.com/p/tree-islands) here. More about plastic in tree nurseries in our detailed [newsletter article](https://vivalaselva.substack.com/p/about-tree-nurseries-and-their-plastic).

### A Brief Retrospective

#### How It All Began

In March 2023, we started preparing the first space for a few hundred trees. We sowed over 200 seeds, about a third of which sprouted. In addition, we gave some seeds another place in the village to experiment with different growth conditions.
However, our nursery was too small. Our first fundraising campaign in June 2023 took our project a significant step forward: we were able to set up a larger area for several thousand seedlings next to it.

So we now have a total of three tree nurseries, a very small one in the middle of the village, a rather small one on the farm, and a slightly larger one next to it. Each of the three offers varying amounts of sun and soil moisture, so we can try out particularly sensitive seeds at all three locations.

### Brief Insights

#### Our Tasks for and around the Saplings

1. Regularly clear the nursery grounds and the surrounding area of overgrown underbrush. Not because we advocate English lawns, but because here in the tropics, we also think a little about our survival and want to keep the workplace as free as possible from poisonous snakes, spiders, and scorpions.

2. From different places on the farm, we bring different types of soil and natural fertilizers to the nursery. To do this, we have to cross our densely overgrown farm on foot. It is hard work to maneuver tons of topsoil and ant dung through impassable terrain. But we are not lacking in motivation for this, after all, it is a suitable nursery for our protégés.

3. In addition, we have to buy seedling bags, fill them with soil, place them in the nursery, and, if necessary, rearrange them or create nursery beds. In both cases, the beds and bags need to be maintained, and excessive wild growth needs to be plucked, and the seedlings need to be protected from predators.

4. In parallel, we regularly check our boundary fences because even the cows from the surrounding pastures already know that we have more tasty greens and always enough fresh water in the streams. We understand the cows, but they cause great damage to the trees on our farm and especially in the nursery.

5. When all these tasks are done or in progress, we can take the most fulfilling step: we can search for more seeds and shoots, bring them to the nursery, and plant them. Here, we often rely on local guides who can lead us to the last representatives of a species.

6. Caring for the seeds, checking their germination processes, and finding solutions when a species does not thrive requires dedication and a spirit of research. Because for the upbringing of some species, neither the people here nor the internet can expect serious help.

7. The shoots that grow out of the nursery are given a protected place on our farm or another well-secured location.

excerpt: Cedar wood is a monoecious, deciduous, medium-sized to large tree usually growing 30 -40 metres tall, exceptionally to 50 metres
general_information: "Cedar wood is a monoecious, deciduous, medium-sized to large tree usually growing 30 -40 metres tall, exceptionally to 50 metres[303
]. The straight, cylindrical bole can be 60 - 120cm in diameter and unbranched for 15 - 24 metres[378
]. It has buttresses that can extend 120 - 360cm up the tree[378
].
One of the world's most important timbers[338
], it has been widely overexploited in the wild and is now frequently cultivated as a plantation tree for its valuable timber, especially in the Americas and Africa[303
]. It is sometimes planted as an ornamental along roads and in parks[303
].
Large specimens have become scarce as a result of overexploitation, and therefore the tree has been listed as 'Endangered' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species(2009)[338
]."

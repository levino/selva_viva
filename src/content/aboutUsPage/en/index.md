  subtitle: OVER TWENTY YEARS OF FOREST PROTECTION
  description: Viva la Selva originated from a love for nature. Our family began protecting their forest and deliberately planting endangered tree species over 20 years ago. The increasingly critical state of many species led us to the decision to share our project and our goals with the rest of the world.

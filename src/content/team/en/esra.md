description: Esra grew up in Germany, holds a second state examination in music and Spanish, worked as a teacher in Germany, and as a translator and DaF (German as a Foreign Language) teacher in Colombia. She is responsible for editing texts and translations, as well as public relations for Viva la Selva, especially in the German-speaking region. Her curiosity about South America led her to Colombia. She loves the mountains—especially in the morning mist—green nature, and climbing.

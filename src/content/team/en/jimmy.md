name: Jimmy
role: Procurement of Seeds and Wild Saplings
description: Jimmy has always worked in forests and fields, where he learned all the tools of traditional farming and carpentry. For several years, he gathered extensive knowledge about tree species and other plants of the rainforest while working as a lumberjack. During this work, he became aware of the rapid decline in biodiversity in the tropical forests of Colombia, and a strong desire to contribute to reforestation grew within him. He lives with his small family on his small farm at the foot of the still wooded mountains.

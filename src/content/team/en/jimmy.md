name: Jimmy
role: Procurement of Seeds and Wild Saplings
description: Jimmy's roots are in the forests and fields, where he picked up traditional farming and woodworking. As a lumberjack, he learned a lot about different trees and plants in the rainforest. That's when he saw how quickly the variety of life in Colombia's tropical forests was disappearing, and he knew he wanted to help bring the woods back to life. Now, he and his family live on their farm near the wooded mountains.

role: Founder, Web Development
description: "Alejandro leads Viva la Selva, developing the website and producing content to realize his long-held dream of planting trees and reviving forests. These are the forests where he grew up exploring on horseback and fishing in the rivers. When he's not dedicated to Viva la Selva, you can find him on the farm, playing the guitar or practicing Latin percussion."

name: Alejandro
role: Founder, Web Development
description: "Alejandro leads the Viva la Selva project, develops the website, and produces videosâ€”all for his childhood dream: saving endangered tree species and reforesting more forests. Forests like the jungles he rode through as a child and fished in their wild rivers. When Alejandro is not taking care of Viva la Selva, he works on the estate, plays the guitar, or drums."

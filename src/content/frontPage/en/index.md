situation:
  title: Tropical Ecosystems Under Threat
  paragraph: Darién, situated in the Caribbean region between Colombia and Panama, faces an ecological crisis. Uncontrolled deforestation is rapidly depleting the once-lush rainforests. Internationally endangered tree species have become exceedingly scarce, making seed collection a daunting task. The ecosystem is on the brink of collapse.

  title: Impact of Deforestation
  paragraph: >-
    Highly prized woods are often harvested from the biggest trees in the rainforest. These trees do a lot more than just store carbon dioxide. They are homes to thousands of other living species. Their leaves provide shade that helps keep forest springs and rivers cool and flowing properly. The roots go deep, keeping the soil healthy and ready for new plants to grow. This helps all kinds of plant and animal species to survive and thrive.

  title: "We Scout, Plant, and Protect"
  paragraph: >-
    At Viva la Selva, endangered native species find sanctuary. We search for and rescue seeds and seedlings of declining species, planting them in a protected, biodiverse environment to ensure their survival in the native ecosystem.

    While not every planted seed becomes a tree, our successes yield a remarkable explosion of life and abundance!

situation:
  title: Tropical Ecosystem in Danger
  paragraph: The Darién in the Caribbean region between Colombia and Panama is in an ecological crisis. Deforestation in the former rainforest region is progressing uncontrollably. Internationally threatened tree species have become so rare in this region that finding their seeds is increasingly difficult. The ecosystem is starting to deteriorate.

problem:
  title: Out of Balance Due to Deforestation
  paragraph: >-
    The most coveted wood comes from giant rainforest trees and other large

    tree species that are much more than just carbon storage. They provide

    habitat for an entire ecosystem, some for over 1000 other species. Their shade and deep roots protect springs and the natural flow of rivers,

    surface temperatures, and fertile soil layers: the basis for

    new growth and thus the preservation of species - of all species.

  title: We Find, Plant, and Protect
  paragraph: >-
    Endangered native species find room to survive at Viva la Selva. We
    search for and rescue seeds and seedlings of dwindling species and plant
    them in a protected, biodiverse environment to preserve them for the native ecosystem.

    Not every planted seed becomes a tree. But where our work succeeds, a miracle of life thrives in unimaginable abundance!

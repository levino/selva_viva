about_us:
  title: Who We Are...
  paragraph: ...a small team with the aim of preserving endangered or rare tree species in the Darien (North Choco, Colombia).

situation:
  title: Tropical Ecosystem in Danger
  paragraph: The Darien in the Caribbean region between Colombia and Panama is in an ecological crisis. Deforestation in the former jungle region is progressing uncontrollably. Internationally endangered tree species have become so rare in this region that the search for their seeds is becoming increasingly difficult. The ecosystem is beginning to deteriorate.

problem:
  title: Imbalance Caused by Deforestation
  paragraph: >-
    The most coveted wood is supplied by jungle giants and other large tree species, which are much more than CO2 stores. They provide habitat for an entire ecosystem, some for over 1000 additional species. Their shade and deep roots protect sources and the natural flow of rivers, surface temperatures, and fertile soil layers: the basis for new growth and, therefore, for the preservation of all species.

solution:
  title: We Find, Plant, and Protect
  paragraph: >-
    Endangered native species find space to survive at Viva la Selva. We search for and rescue seeds and seedlings of dwindling species and plant them in a protected, diverse environment to maintain them in the local ecosystem.
    Not every planted seed becomes a tree. But where our work succeeds, a miracle of life occurs in unimaginable abundance!

situation:
  title: Critical State of Tropical Ecosystem
  paragraph: Darién, situated in the Caribbean region between Colombia and Panama, faces an ecological crisis. Uncontrolled deforestation is rapidly depleting the once-lush rainforests. Internationally endangered tree species have become exceedingly scarce, making seed collection a daunting task. The ecosystem is on the brink of collapse.

  title: Impact of Deforestation
  paragraph: >-
    The most sought-after wood comes from rainforest giants and other large tree species, which are much more than CO2 storages. They provide habitat for an entire biotope, some for over 1000 other species. Their shade and deep roots protect springs and the natural flow of rivers, surface temperatures, and fertile soil layers: the basis for new shoots and thus also for the preservation of species - all species.

  title: "Our Approach: Discover, Plant, and Protect"
  paragraph: >-
    At Viva la Selva, endangered native species find sanctuary. We search for and rescue seeds and seedlings of declining species, planting them in a protected, biodiverse environment to ensure their survival in the native ecosystem.

    While not every planted seed becomes a tree, our successes yield a remarkable explosion of life and abundance!
